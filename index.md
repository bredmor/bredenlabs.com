## About Me

My name is **Morgan Breden**, I'm a web developer by trade. I've been a hobbyist since I was a child, and working in the field professionally since 2009. While I primarily work in the LAMP stack, my experience branches out into systems administration, desktop development, machine learning, robotics and more.

## Open Source Projects

Some of my current OSS work includes:

### [Phreloader](https://github.com/bredmor/phreloader)
*A PHP 7.4+ Automatic Preloader*

Phreloader provides a dynamic preload entrypoint for opcache by reading a project's composer classmap.

### [Comment-Analyzer](https://github.com/bredmor/comment-analyzer)
*PHP Wrapper for the Google Perspective Comment Analyzer API*

Comment-Analyzer is an API library that allows for the automatic evaluation of text in multiple languages via assesment criteria like overall toxicity, attacks on identity, insults, profanity, threats and more. This library is currently in use by multiple websites to cut down on user to user harassment.

### [Laradocker](https://github.com/bredmor/laradocker)
*Docker image for Laravel & the Laravel Vapor CI environment*

Laradocker (and [Vapor-Action](https://github.com/bredmor/vapor-action)) provide an up-to-date environment for automatically testing Laravel applications and deploying them to AWS Lambda via the Laravel Vapor CI system. This coupled CI/CD system is currently in use by multiple projects I touch on a day to day basis.

## Skillset

**Languages**: PHP, Python, Elixir, Node.JS, Javascript, C#, C

**Frameworks**: Laravel, Symfony, Phoenix, Express, Vue, React 

**Systems**: Linux(Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS), Windows (7, 10 and Server 2019)
